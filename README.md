Politicoin is my first attempt at a cryptocurrency, written in Solidity for use on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It includes the essential functions of a currency--transfer, approve, etc--as well as a method of voting by paying a nominal fee 
to increase the number of "votes" associated with a string value.
